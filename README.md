# Audit Portfolio

This repository collects some of the published reports on which I worked as an auditor.

My favorite protocols were:

- Pendle
- Safe
- Brahma
- CoW
- Solady
- Lido

Some other notable mentions are:

- Aave
- Immunefi
- Trader Joe (Let's F***ing Joe)

Many of the audits I participated in were private engagements. Additionally, as almost any other auditor, I recommend not looking at older reports; there will be things that are funny these days >ᴗ<
